# Lisp_to_JS_converter

## What is this repository for? ##
The goal is a service that can convert programs in common lisp into their javascript equivalent.

## Capabilities ##
The service supports Lisp operators(and, mod,incf, decf, =, >, <, <=, >=, +, -, *, /, /=), variable declaration(defvar defconstant), function declaration(defun), and if block.

## Limitations ##
Should expand service supporting for the rest LISP decisions(e.g. when), loops etc.
